## About
The Blogging Platform API is a backend service for managing users and blog posts. It includes features like user authentication (JWT), post creation, editing, deletion, and viewing posts. This API can be integrated into a frontend application to create a fully functional blogging platform.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- Django 
- Django REST Framework
- JWT Authentication for security
- SQLite (or PostgreSQL) for the database

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- pip package manager
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm)

### Steps to Install

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/macro-dynamic/blogging-platform-api.git
   cd blogging-platform-api
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply migrations to set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser to access the admin panel:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to test the API.

## Setup

To configure the project, make sure to set the following in your `settings.py` file:

- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Add the domain names or IP addresses that are allowed to access the API.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for your project (ensure it is kept secure).

## Endpoints

### Authentication
- **POST** `/api/token/`: Obtain a JWT token by providing `username` and `password`.
- **POST** `/api/token/refresh/`: Refresh the JWT token.

### Blog Posts
- **GET** `/api/posts/`: Get a list of all blog posts.
- **POST** `/api/posts/`: Create a new blog post (Requires authentication).
- **GET** `/api/posts/<id>/`: Get a specific post by ID.
- **PUT** `/api/posts/<id>/`: Update a specific post by ID (Requires authentication).
- **DELETE** `/api/posts/<id>/`: Delete a specific post by ID (Requires authentication).

### User
- **POST** `/api/register/`: Register a new user.
- **POST** `/api/login/`: Login an existing user.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

This will run the unit tests for the project.
